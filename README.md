Method 1 vectorization technique: One hot encoding for both the element and the composition.
Method 2 vectorization technique: Weights of the element used from: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-35766-5 and each vectorized element is then multiplied with the composition it has in the alloy
Method 3 vectorization technique: Weights of the element used from: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-35766-5 and one hot encoding used for the composition value

We will compare the best model with previous work.
