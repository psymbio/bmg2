© 2018 Elsevier Ltd SO2-responsive homopolypeptide with tri(ethylene glycol), 1,2,3-triazole linkages and N-butylimidazolium iodide pendants (P4) were prepared by the ring-opening polymerization of γ-2-(2-(2-chloroethoxy)ethoxy)ethyl-L-glutamic acid based N-carboxyanhydride then post-polymerization to the side-chain, by the nucleophilic substitution of the chloro group in the presence of NaN3, followed by the copper-mediated 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, and subsequent ion-exchange reaction. 1H NMR analysis revealed that SO2 interacted with 1,2,3-triazole group leading to polymer aggregation. The P4/SO2 aqueous solution is multi-responsive that can be triggered by gas (N2/SO2), temperature, and oxidation (i.e., H2O2). Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel modified by P4 and BaSO3 particles were prepared, the resulting hydrogel showed improved mechanical properties in terms of both stiffness and toughness.
© 2018 Elsevier Ltd Chemistry in general, but polymer chemistry in particular has to face the major challenge of finding solutions to ensure a sustainable and environmental-benign development of industry to answer consumer needs. Aldehydes are very important chemical groups for polymer science of the synthesis of phenolic resins for example, however, most molecular aldehydes (such as formaldehyde) are toxic. Finding less toxic and sustainable aldehydes is not easy because this functional group is relatively scarce in nature. In consequence aldehydes-containing building blocks must be synthesized. The present review gives an overview of the different synthetic methods to prepare such aldehyde building blocks. It then focusses on the use of radically polymerizable aldehyde-containing monomers to prepare polymers and materials featuring available aldehyde pendent group. Indeed, owing to the rich reactivity and properties of aldehydes, such functional polymers will undoubtedly lead to the development of high-added value applications. This review also gives a brief overview of such potential applications.
© 2018 Elsevier Ltd To evaluate the influence of low molecular weight polymers synthesized through soap-free emulsion polymerization on the indicator microorganism, Micrococcus luteus, methyl methacrylate (MMA) and styrene were polymerized by using various initiators. The MMA polymer colloid was not toxic to M. luteus. High volumes of polystyrene were continuously synthesized, and low-molecular weight polystyrenes were removed from the suspension to the supernatant. During the bioassay test, as the molecular weight of the cationic polystyrene in the supernatant decreased, the inhibition zone against M. luteus grew larger. Low molecular weight cationic polystyrene was toxic to M. luteus. Hence, the supernatant containing low molecular weight cationic polystyrenes (particularly those with molecular weights below 1000 g/mol) obtained from soap-free emulsion polymerization should be treated carefully prior to its discharge to the environment. Moreover, such supernatants should be treated with more care if they are to be discharged into seas or rivers. One solution to reduce the toxicity of the supernatant against M. luteus is the addition of N-vinylacetamide monomers during polymerization.
© 2018 Elsevier Ltd Palladium-catalysed oxidative carbonylation (PCOC) of alkynes is a promising engine for building smart pulsatile polymeric systems, as it has demonstrated (in certain configurations) sustained regular oscillations in pH and redox potential for up to one month of monitoring in a batch reactor. Recent developments in polymer-supported palladium catalysts have demonstrated the full capacity of this reaction – in a macrogel that experienced oscillations in volume, while releasing a drug load. In this work, we demonstrate reproducible oscillations (more than 100 h duration) in a proline-functionalised chitosan-palladium system (Chi-Pro-Pd), using both small molecule (phenylacetylene) and polymeric (pegylated dialkyne) substrate, for the first time. Moreover, by functionalising chitosan with proline ligands, we dramatically reduced halide-mediated leaching of palladium, which readily occurred in non-functionalised chitosan-palladium catalysts (Chi-Pd). Oscillatory patterns for both systems confirm the need for fabricating functionalised chitosan supports to improve catalyst reusability and minimise loss of palladium.
© 2018 Elsevier Ltd Nanoscale drug delivery systems devised from biocompatible and biodegradable molecules with functional groups which are readily amenable to external stimuli, have become a promising approach to circumvent the pitfalls associated with the hydrophobic drugs concomitant with the amplification of drugs’ action. Taking the cognizance of advantages offered by nanostructures and also in search of amphiphiles with intended biomedical applications, a novel and elite family of amphiphilic system that can self-assemble into enzyme-responsive supramolecular architectures has been synthesized via a chemo-enzymatic approach using an immobilized enzyme (lipase) from Candida antarctica (Novozym 435) and employing biocompatible starting materials, i.e. p-hydroxybenzoic acid, monomethoxypolyethyleneglycol (mPEG), and glycerol. The aggregation behavior of the resulting bolaamphiphiles have been studied using critical aggregation concentration and dynamic light scattering measurements, further supplemented by cryogenic transmission electron microscopic studies. The developed amphiphiles render efficient solubilization of model hydrophobic drugs and dyes, e.g. Nile red, nimodipine, and curcumin in aqueous solution. Moreover, the results demonstrate that a subtle structural modulation of the amphiphilic system alters the transportation behavior of the guest molecule. The investigation of the enzyme-responsive behavior of the synthesized bolaamphiphiles using a hydrolase enzyme, Candida antarctica lipase reveals that amide based nanocarriers disassemble and release the encapsulated cargo on incubation with the enzyme. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay unravels negligible cytotoxicity of the bolaamphiphiles at the tested concentrations, indicating their relevance in the development of nanocarriers for biomedical applications.
© 2018 Elsevier Ltd The comprehensive investigations including the influence of architecture, intra– and intermolecular interactions and backbone conformation on the glass transition activation energy and the temperature dependence of segmental relaxation (fragility) in a series (azo)polyimides are presented. The studies were carried out using DSC measurements. To understand the microscopic parameters that control the glass transition phenomenon the activation energy was calculated using two different approaches, i.e., Kissinger and Moynihan models. The behavior of polyimides near the glass transition was investigated in the context of formation intra- and intermolecular H-bonds, which impact on rigidity and conformation of main and side chains of the polymers. Presence of the H-bonds was confirmed experimentally by 1H NMR and FTIR spectroscopes and theoretically by DFT simulations. Our investigations showed, that the presence of intra- and intermolecular interactions cause different conformations of the polymer chain, what may be the key to solve the puzzle of fragility parameter of polymers.
© 2018 Elsevier Ltd A major obstacle in the study of membrane proteins is the challenge in generating purified targets in a stable and native conformation. Potentially destabilizing detergents are often used to extract targets out of their native membranes. One approach to overcome these destabilization issues is to present targets in a lipid bilayer environment. While numerous lipid bilayer presentation approaches such as Nanodiscs and liposomes have been used through the years, most still require a detergent purified protein intermediate. Styrene-maleic acid lipoparticles (SMALPs) have been developed to directly solubilize membranes without the use of detergents and present membrane proteins in a native lipid bilayer environment. These discoidal lipid bilayer particles have been evaluated on several membrane protein classes (e.g. ion channels, transporters) and applications (e.g. spectroscopy, electron microscopy). Here, cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), a class A G-protein coupled receptor, was incorporated into a SMALP (CB1-SMALP) and shown to retain its native fold through binding studies with a CB1-specific conformational antibody. The binding studies were conducted in yeast and mammalian display formats using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Compared to detergent preparations, CB1-SMALP also exhibited a marked increase in thermostability. This study provides the framework for a platform to generate full-length membrane protein screening antigens for flow cytometry-based studies.
© 2018 Elsevier Ltd A novel approach for the synthesis of miktoarm star copolymers by the combination of ring opening polymerization (ROP) and Type II photopolymerization is described. The method pertains to the use of a multifunctional initiator, bearing primary hydroxyl and tertiary amine functionalities, for the sequential or simultaneous polymerization of vinyl and lactone monomers under mild conditions. In the first step, phosphazene base (P2-t-Bu) catalyzed ROP of ε-caprolactone is accomplished. Subsequently, thus obtained poly(ε-caprolactone) with amine end groups was used as co-initiator for the polymerization of methyl methacrylate by utilizing conventional Type II photoinitiators. The structures, molecular weight characteristics and thermal properties of the polymers are analyzed by NMR, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements, respectively.
© 2018 Elsevier Ltd In this paper, laboratory synthesized Phenol-paraPhenyleneDiAmine (P-pPDA) benzoxazine containing different amounts of B-trimesityl-N-triphenylborazine was applied by spin coating on aluminum and thermally cured. The addition of the borazine derivative (borazine 1) does not appear to modify the curing characteristics of the P-pPDA matrix itself as shown by FTIR, DSC and DEA analyses; however, some interactions - chemical and/or physical (co-crystallization) – between P-pPDA and borazine 1 cannot be excluded. The microstructure of the composites is characterized by a two phase system consisting of a dispersion of nanosized (10–20 nm) clusters for the lowest borazine 1 concentration (0.5 wt%), evolving towards bigger (100–200 nm), agglomerated clusters for higher borazine 1 concentrations (3 wt%) and finally, continuous, dendritic structures within the P-pPDA matrix for the highest borazine 1 concentration (10 wt%). The benzoxazine composite coating containing 0.5 wt% trimesitylborazine derivative showed a largely increased and durable ability to protect the aluminum substrate. It is shown that a highly capacitive behavior and durable barrier properties can be obtained for P-pPDA coatings containing such a low amount of borazine derivative homogeneously dispersed in the benzoxazine matrix. For concentrations of 3 wt%, as agglomeration took place and dendrites appeared for the highest concentration of borazine derivative (10 wt%), the corrosion resistance decreased with time.
© 2018 Elsevier Ltd In this study, we report the synthesis of pybox zinc(II) complex-containing thermo-responsive copolymer through activated ester strategy and their application in Knoevenagel condensation as an efficient and recoverable catalyst. First, a series of thermo-responsive copolymers P(MASI-co-DEGMMA-co-OEGMMA300) of activated ester monomer N-methacryloxysuccinimide (MASI), ethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate (DEGMMA) and oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (OEGMMA300) were synthesized through free-radical copolymerization using azodiisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as an initiator in solution polymerization. The lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the P(MASI-co-DEGMMA-co-OEGMMA300) copolymers was controlled by adjusting the mole fractions of the monomers. The synthesized copolymers were well characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR), infrared spectrum (FTIR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Then, pybox ligand with a terminal amino group was introduced into P(MASI-co-DEGMMA-co-OEGMMA300) based on activated ester functionalization, and further coordinate with ZnCl2 to afford a pybox zinc(II) complex-containing thermo-responsive copolymer. The zinc complex-containing polymer displayed excellent catalytic activities for Knoevenagel condensation reaction in water at room temperature, and it can be easily recovered by centrifugation at a higher temperature, above the LCST of the copolymer after reaction. The recovered catalyst can be reused at least five cycles without obvious decrease in catalytic activity.
